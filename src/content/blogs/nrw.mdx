# 1st Place at NRW – Building AeroVista

Some projects start with a feature idea.

Ours started with a question:

> If we still struggle to monitor crops, inspect construction sites, or track environmental change on Earth… how can we ever expect to survive on Mars?

That question led us to build **AeroVista**, and eventually, it led us to win **1st Place at the Entrepreneurial Challenge during Robotics National Weekend (NRW)**.

## The Problem

Today, businesses don’t lack data — they lack **reliable, real-time, actionable insights**.

- Farmers walk fields or rely on low-resolution satellite images.
- Construction managers deal with outdated visuals that cause delays and risks.
- Environmental monitoring is often reactive instead of proactive.

We needed better eyes in the sky.

## The Solution: AeroVista

AeroVista is an **aerial intelligence platform** combining autonomous drone fleets with AI-powered analysis.

Instead of building new hardware, we leveraged DJI drones equipped with RTK for centimeter-level precision. On top of that, we built a software layer that transforms raw images into insights:

- NDVI maps to detect crop stress
- 3D reconstructions of construction sites
- Environmental change alerts
- Automated, ready-to-use reports

No manual piloting. No complex workflows. Just plug in the location and get clear, data-driven results.

## Why It Mattered

This wasn’t just about cool robotics.

Smarter aerial data means:

- Higher agricultural yields with fewer resources
- Safer and more efficient construction
- Better protection of ecosystems

And long-term?  
The same autonomous systems that optimize Earth today could support human settlements on Mars tomorrow.

## The Real Win

Winning 1st place was incredible — but the real highlight was the team.

The late-night discussions.  
The last-minute pitch adjustments.  
The shared belief that we could aim bigger than just another hackathon project.

We weren’t just building a product.

We were building infrastructure — for Earth… and beyond.
